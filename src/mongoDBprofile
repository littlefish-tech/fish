design the mongodb backend for storing profiles.
but saving this is easy
  just what is the collection, what is the  key and what is the data..


the collection should save a user frofile preference

4 things needs to be save for user profile preference: 
    - Layout
    - Creds
    - Grids
    - AppData

the format should be a hash to save in the mongodb
the key is the user's user name
the value is also a hash, with key layout, creds, grids, and appdata
